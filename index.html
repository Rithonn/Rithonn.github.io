        <h2>YCPHacks Wesbite Recreation</h2>
        <p>
           For a project in my Software Engineering course I was tasked with recreating York College's Hackathon website with a select group of 
           individuals. The project lasted a span of 4 months and involved working in a team of 3 with meeting deadlines. The project can be found
           <a style="color: white;" href="https://github.com/Rithonn/ycphacks_website">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Spring Boot Example Project</h2>
        <p>
            As part of wanting to teach myself something that was more up to date compared to the YCPHacks website recreation, I focused my sights on
            Spring Boot. I taught myself this library extension of java in preperation for future projects to come along with learning a more up to date
            system for website development. 
        </p>
